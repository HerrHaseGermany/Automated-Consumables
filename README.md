# Automated-Consumables
Automatically updates macros for food and drinks (Classic Era).

Creates/updates two macros:
- `ACbutton1`: `Shift` = best food, `Ctrl` = best drink, no modifier = best food+drink (or best available).
- `ACbutton2`: same idea, with `Shift`/`Ctrl` swapped.

Notes:
- This addon only manages `ACbutton1` and `ACbutton2`.
- “Best” is determined by scanning your bags and reading each Food & Drink tooltip restore amounts.
